<h1>Mathematics Tools</h1>

<p> These tools are currently available.  None of them satisfy me. </p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/" target="_blank">Isabelle</a></td>
    <td>Too limiting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://coq.inria.fr/" target="_blank">Coq</a></td>
    <td>Too limiting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">HOL</a></td>
    <td>Rebuilds everything</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/~RAFFALLI/phox.html" target="_blank">Phox</a></td>
    <td>Too arcane</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://www.mizar.org/" target="_blank">Mizar</a></td>
    <td>Too much notation</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p> These are just some of the reasons for rejecting these tools.  I do not need tools that are bloated with features, too complex, or too limiting from the perspective of mathematics.  Some tools, such as HOL, rebuild all theorems everytime they are loaded, which means that all effort gets reduplicated.  Instead, the tool I want should build on previously built materials without reduplication. </p>

<h2> The QED Project </h2>

<p> The <a href="http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/qedres01.htm" target="_blank">QED Project</a> is very promising, but apparently has never gotten underway. The idea is to form a community around the automation of mathematics.  </p>
